        Question 2
       
        Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.
        The words in paragraph are case-insensitive and the answer should be returned in lowercase.
        Example 1:
        Input: paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.", banned = ["hit"]
        Output: "ball"
        Explanation: "hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word. "ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
        Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive, that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.
        Example 2:
        Input: paragraph = "a.", banned = []

        •	The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
        •	The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
        Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.
        The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.

        Question 6
        You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an array widths denoting how many pixels wide each lowercase English letter is. Specifically, widths[0] is the width of 'a', widths[1] is the width of 'b', and so on.
        You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels. Then, from where you stopped in s, continue writing as many letters as you can on the second line. Continue this process until you have written all of s.
        Return an array result of length 2 where:
             •	result[0] is the total number of lines.
             •	result[1] is the width of the last line in pixels.

        Output: [3,60]
        Explanation: You can write s as follows:
                     abcdefghij  	 // 100 pixels wide
                     klmnopqrst  	 // 100 pixels wide
                     uvwxyz      	 // 60 pixels wide
                     There are a total of 3 lines, and the last line is 60 pixels wide.

         Input: widths = [4,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10], 
         s = "bbbcccdddaaa"
         Output: [2,4]
         Explanation: You can write s as follows:

                      a           	 // 4 pixels wide

        Question 10:
        Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.
        You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
        •	Insert a character
        •	Delete a character
        •	Replace a character
         Note: Try to come up with a solution that has polynomial runtime, then try to optimize it to quadratic runtime.
        Example 1:
        Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
        Output: 3
        Explanation: 
        horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
        rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
        rose -> ros (remove 'e')
